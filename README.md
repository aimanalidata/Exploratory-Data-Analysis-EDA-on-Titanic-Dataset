# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-on-Titanic-Dataset
This repository is dedicated to performing a thorough exploratory data analysis of the Titanic passenger dataset. The analysis focuses on identifying the factors that influenced the survival rates of passengers, utilizing Python and its powerful libraries. The project encapsulates the complete workflow from data loading to in-depth visual exploration and interpretation of the data.

## Features
- **Data Loading**: Efficient loading of the Titanic dataset from a CSV file using Pandas.
- **Data Cleaning**: Comprehensive data cleaning including handling of missing values, erroneous entries, and data type conversions to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Detailed analysis of various factors such as gender, passenger class, embarkation points, and age groups. Each factor's impact on survival rates is explored.
- **Visualizations**: Rich visual representations for each analysis, utilizing libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to craft intuitive charts and plots.
- **Insights and Conclusions**: Summarization of critical insights derived from the data with conclusions that provide a narrative understanding of the factors affecting survival.
